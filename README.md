# Welcome to my first machine learning project that it is not just a jupyter Notebook

#### The packages for this project are in the requirements.txt file so you just have to run pip install -r requirements.txt
#### run_app.sh it is a shortcut to activate the venv (I advice you to name it venv) and run the app

## The first dataset in which we are working is heart.csv which contains the data to determinate if a patient has or not a heart disease. This is a supervised ML problem since it is a classification. 

### 1 - Loading the data

All datasets used in this project are the datasets directory. Those are kaggle datasets but a little modified in order to work better with our models. The first thing we are trying to do is to run a PCA algorith to determinate the features that are the best to predict a result


### 2 - USING PCA

We used PCA algorithm to determinate how many features are eally useful to predict. We found that using 3 artificial features, generated by the PCA algorithm based on the original ones we got a score between 78% and 80%, depending if PCA or IPCA was used.
The advantage of IPCA it's that is better for running in computers with limited resources
